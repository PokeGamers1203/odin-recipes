# odin-recipes
In this Odin project, I will create an HTML page containing links to 
some of my favorite recipes online. This will help solidify my
understanding in HTML.

UPDATE: I have successfully grasped a basic understanding of the workflow with Git and HTML programming. Thanks, Odin Project! :)
