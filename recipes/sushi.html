        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Sushi is a Japanese dish prepared with vinegared rice, can contain sugar and salt, and can contain ingredients like seafood or vegetables.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2/3 cup water</li>
            <li>1/3 cup medium-grain white rice, uncooked</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
            <li>4 sheets nori (dry seaweed)</li>
            <li>4 ounces smoked salmon, cut into strips</li>
            <li>2 ounces cold cream cheese, cut into thin strips</li>
            <li>4 scallions, sliced into thin strips</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring water and rice to a boil in  a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and water has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from the heat and cool, about 10 minutes. Toss with vinegar.</li>
            <li>Place one sheet of nori on a rolling mat, layer with 1/4 of the rice, and press rice out to the edges. Lay 1/4 of the salmon, 1/4 of the cream cheese, and 1/4 of the scallions in the center. Roll up carefully and wrap. Repeat with remaining nori, rice, salmon, cream cheese, and scallions. Place in the refrigerator until chilled, at least one hour.</li>
            <li>Remove sushi rolls from the refrigerator, discard plastic wrap, and cut each roll into 6 slices. Layer all rolls on a platter.</li>
        </ol>
